**Discover the cosmic connection in your name**

Starseed is an interactive web application that reveals the hidden cosmic connections within your name by mapping name syllables (Namakshara) to the ancient Nakshatra system from Vedic astrology.

## ‚ú® What is Starseed?

Every name contains a vibrational essence - a "seed syllable" that connects you to specific celestial energies. The Starseed system identifies these syllables and maps them to the 27 Nakshatras (lunar mansions), revealing:

- **Your Soul Syllable**: The core vibrational sound in your name
- **Nakshatra Connection**: Which lunar mansion influences your energy
- **Cosmic Symbolism**: Sacred symbols, ruling planets, and deities associated with your name
- **Spiritual Insights**: Deep connections to ancient celestial wisdom

## üåô Understanding Nakshatras

The Nakshatra system is a foundational element of Vedic astrology, representing 27 sectors of the sky through which the Moon travels. Each Nakshatra carries unique:

- **Symbolic Meaning**: Sacred symbols that represent cosmic forces
- **Planetary Influence**: Ruling planets that shape energy patterns
- **Divine Connection**: Deities that embody the Nakshatra's essence
- **Life Path Insights**: Personality traits and life themes

## üåü Philosophy

> "Every name of a person, place, or organization has a core syllable which creates a certain vibration - and that vibration is linked to a Nakshatra (lunar mansion or collection of stars). This syllable is like the seed which grows into a tree to yield a fruit (title or name). Just as a seed is for a tree, a syllable is for a name. Due to the relationship between this seed syllable and the vibrational energy of stars, we call this system 'Starseed'."
